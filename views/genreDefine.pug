                                            | to keep it. Story ideas begin with a strong character and meaningful, directed action.
                                            | The use of suspense and the interplay of human relationships are two features of
                                            | effective juvenile fiction. Books and stories are told almost exclusively from a
                                            | single viewpoint (in first or third person), as this technique helps to establish
