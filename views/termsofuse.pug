We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Zapper, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Zapper, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
